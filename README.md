# Docker Weather App

This weather web app built with TypeScript. It uses the browser's geolocation API to fetch your current position and displays real-time weather data for your location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Features

- **Geolocation:** Automatically detects your location using the browser's geolocation API.
- **Live Weather Data:** Fetches and displays weather information (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.) for your current position.
- **Dockerized:** Easily run the app in a Docker container for local development, testing, or deployment.

Feel free to visit the site and see live weather updates for your location!
